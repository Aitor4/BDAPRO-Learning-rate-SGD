    * Compute an updated value for weights given the parameters. Performs one update step at a time

    * @param weightsOld - Column matrix of size dx1 where d is the number of features.
    * @param gradient - Column matrix of size dx1 where d is the number of features.
    * @param inStepSize - step size parameter (also named learning rate) which indicates the strength of the
    *                   update based on the gradient.
    * @param smoothingTerm - Smoothing term in the denominator of the equation that avoids division by 0.
    *                  It is usually a very small value (e.g. 1e-6)
    * @param iter - Iteration number (used if we decide to decay the learning rate across iterations)
    * @param regParam - Regularization parameter (only used if the type of regularization is not 0)
    * @param regType - Which type of regularization is used:
    *                0: no regularization, 1: L1 regularization, 2: L2 regularization
    * @param decay - Whether to decay or not the stepSize across iterations (divide by the square root of
    *              the iterations)
    * @return A tuple of 2 elements. The first element is a column matrix containing updated weights,
    *         and the second element is the regularization value computed using updated weights (useful for the
    *         regularized loss)
